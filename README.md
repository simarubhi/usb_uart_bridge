# USB to UART Bridge

## Goal

I decided to build a small USB to UART Bridge as a mini project. This will be useful in my future projects with debugging and flashing custom micro controller boards.

## Schematic

## PCB Layout

The PCB layout is nearly done, parts should be in by ~March 15th, and assembly will take place shortly after.
