# USB to UART Bridge

## Overview

In order to debug and flash custom microcontroller boards for future projects, I designed a USB to UART bridge with the CP2102N chip in KiCad. Parts are currently in transit and assembly will begin soon!

Total Cost Per Board: ~$4.81<br>
Equivalent Board On Market: $4.54

Originally my board was cheaper but after review, I noticed I had accidentally selected 203 (imperial) components which would be too small to solder by hand. They have now been replaced by 805 components. My board is now slightly more expensive than the market but offers led indicators, overvoltage protection, and a clean layout. Given the benefits of the project, I am happy with the outcome.
