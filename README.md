# USB to UART Bridge

## Overview

In order to debug and flash custom microcontroller boards for future projects, I designed a USB to UART bridge with the CP2102N chip in KiCad. Parts are currently in transit and assembly will begin soon!

Total Cost Per Board: ~$5.21<br>
Equivalent Board On Market: $5.59

Not only is my price per board cheaper than buying a prebuilt board, but it also offers proper overvoltage protection and LED indicators.
